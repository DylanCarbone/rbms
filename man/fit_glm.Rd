\title{fit_glm
Fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to predict daily count per site, using the regional flight curve as offset. Function used in \link{impute_count}.}
\usage{
fit_glm(sp_count_flight_y, non_zero, FamilyGlm)
}
\arguments{
\item{sp_count_flight_y}{data.table with time series of the expected relative abundance of butterfly count per day (NM) for the year of interest,
or the nearest available.}

\item{non_zero}{vector of sites with non-zero value to be included in the model (see detail)}

\item{FamilyGlm}{string for the distribution to be used for the error term in the GLM, inherited from \link{impute_count}, default='quasipoisson'.}
}
\value{
A a list of objects, i) **sp_count_flight_y**: data.table with data and expected relative abundance of butterfly count per day (NM) for the year or the nearest year where
        a fligh curve (phenology) is available \code{sp_count_flight_y} and ii) **glm_obj_site**:a glm object for the model \code{glm_obj_site}.

\description{
fit_glm
Fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to predict daily count per site, using the regional flight curve as offset. Function used in \link{impute_count}.
}
\details{
GLM model is only fitted for site with observations, non-zero, as the abundance for sites where count are only zeros is expected to be null
