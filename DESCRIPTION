Description: Implementation of the Generalize Abundance Index using the Spline method presented in Dennis et al. 2016, an adaptation of the two-stage model developed by Dennis et al. 2013 and extended in Schmucki et al. 2017. This package compute the flight curve from a set of monitoring sites and compute the abundance index, using the flight curve to impute values where weekly counts are missing. This is a fully revised version of the former RegionalGAM package. The rbms package has been totally rewritten and build on a more robust and efficient programming framework, providing more functionality and flexibility to the end-user.
